    <h1>What is Biometric?</h1>
    <p>Biometric is identifying or authenticating an individual using a scan.  There are different types of Biometrics although somre are visual, auitory, and behavioural. For Visual there are: Ear scan, iris recognition, retina recognition, face recognition, and fingerprint recognition. As of behavioural there is gait and typing recognition. Finally for auditory there is speaker identification.</p>
